# About the code
If you are going to copy this code in your android studio the app is not going to start, you are going to need all the document file, so if you are one of the judges and you want to see it contact us.

We have choosen this part of the code because is the most explicative one, it contains the major part of the software interactions between classes, but there are more files that we have written that you need to install in order to make it run properly on your simulator.

we are planning to add more classes in order to develope all the functionnalities of our invision prototype
