# Safe Harbour
Hi, we are a group of students from Italy that gathered toghether in order to compete to the HCL Better health Hackaton.

By clicking the link in the project page or randomly visiting this repo you have now acces to part of the work we've done.

We are driven by the idea to develope this project in order to tackle one of the pandemic problems and make the situation a little bit better, if you want you can help us with some suggestions, here is our idea, we hope you find it as interesting as we do.  

## :fire: Our challenge

If you live in a country that has passed the peak of the curve you are essentially free to go out but some restriction remains, so as the virus do, but not all people or all businesses respect the basic restrictions, such as using hand sanitizer, not crowding, wearing facemask if needed and so on. 

These may seem neglectable indications but they are important for our safety, we noticed that not everyone respect them, so: What if there was a system to report good or bad behaviours of people, in order to choose where to go when we are outside? 

## :bulb: The idea

We are trying to develope a new application that is going to give people the ability to report specific unhealty behaviours of other people or businesses or places in general that are not well equipped to standad security precautions. 

So the next time you are in a crowded place or in a bar that doesen't respect safety standards you can report it in our app, so other users are going to avoid visiting places with bad reports and prefer going where there are good ones, or if they are reported maybe they will change and adapt to standards.

## :gem: What makes it so special

* You have now the possibility to choose the safest places to go or visit in order to have a higher level  of confidence if you need to go out

* The data that is collected is quite important, because if a place for example has only good reviews, that are detected, this could affect his ensurance

* It could be used by police officers in order to see where to intervene (in case of crowding or bad hygenical standards)

* We could see the places where the virus has higher incidence (due to poor safety measures that generates bad reviews) and better cointain virus spreading

## :trumpet: How we are going to achieve it

1) The app gives you the acces to google maps, manage user interactions, displays what other users have reported and makes you do your own report

2) The Firebase database tackle all the data storage,management and analythics and send the result to users or to us

## :triangular_ruler: User Tools

* Google maps markers and features

* Business account (if you are a business owner you can have an account that lets you deny or remove false reports and have other interesting functionalities)

* Incognito mode

* Safety level

* Others (we have some other ideas that are displayed in our presentation)
